These files were originally written by Marcus Comstedt, and placed in the Public
Domain. I have made a few changes to some of these files, although nothing that
would require Copyright protection in and of itself. Original versions of these
files can be obtained from http://mc.pp.se/dc/ (on the Software page, look for
the Example Software section).

These files were provided as-is with no warranty whatsoever. That applies to the
modified versions too, of course.

startup.s
---------
This file was adapted from code also from Marcus Comstedt and placed in the
Public Domain. However, a significant amount of additional code was added to
this file in creating this program. The new code (the _boot_stub function,
especially) is GPLv3'ed, like the rest of the program.
